## Realtime Multimodal Desktop Assistant

A real-time multimodal desktop assistant.

This application captures microphone input and full-screen context, sends the realtime stream to Gemini Live API, and responds with low-latency voice and contextual guidance. The backend stays out of the audio/video hot path and is responsible only for ephemeral token issuance, lightweight tools, session checkpointing, and error reporting.

## Current Status

### Implemented today

* Electron overlay shell with React renderer
* Typed preload bridge and IPC surface
* Backend health and stub session token path
* Desktop settings persistence and overlay interaction behavior
* Unit and component tests across shared packages, API, and desktop

### Planned next

* real ephemeral token issuance
* desktop session controller and transport adapter
* text-first realtime turn
* audio, interruption, checkpointing, and screen streaming

## 🎯 Goals

* Natural voice interaction with interruption support
* Full-screen awareness with lightweight adaptive capture
* Low-latency realtime responses
* Secure client-to-server auth using ephemeral tokens
* Simple MVP architecture with room for a future "Thinking mode"

## 🧱 Core Stack

### 🖥️ Desktop

* Electron
* React
* TypeScript

### ⚙️ Backend

* NestJS
* TypeScript

### ☁️ Cloud

* Google Cloud Run

### 🤖 AI

* Gemini Developer API
* Gemini Live API

## 🏗️ Architecture

### ⚡ Realtime hot path

Desktop client → Gemini Live API

### 🛠️ Backend responsibilities

* Issue ephemeral tokens
* Expose lightweight tools
* Store short session checkpoints
* Receive error reports and logs

### 🚫 Non-goals for MVP

* No backend proxy for audio/video streaming
* No Vertex AI in the realtime path
* No ADK in the MVP path
* No multi-agent orchestration
* No long-term memory system

## 🧭 Key Product Principles

* Low latency is a first-class requirement
* Voice interruption must feel immediate
* Screen capture must stay lightweight and adaptive
* Security defaults must remain strict
* Prefer TDD whenever practical
* Keep the MVP narrow and demo-focused

## 🔄 High-Level Flow

1. The desktop app requests an ephemeral token from the backend.
2. The backend returns a short-lived token for Live API usage.
3. The desktop client opens a realtime session directly with Gemini Live API.
4. The client streams:

   * microphone audio
   * compressed screen frames
5. The model returns:

   * response audio
   * text/transcript events
   * realtime guidance
6. The backend is used only when needed for:

   * token refresh
   * HD screenshot tooling
   * visual summary generation
   * session checkpointing
   * error reporting

## 🖥️ Desktop App Responsibilities

* Capture microphone input
* Capture the full screen
* Run local VAD for interruption detection
* Play model audio output
* Render transcript and session state
* Request HD screenshots when needed
* Connect directly to Gemini Live API

## 🔌 Backend Responsibilities

* `POST /session/token`
* Planned: `POST /session/checkpoint`
* Planned: `POST /tool/screenshot-hd`
* Planned: `POST /tool/visual-summary`
* Planned: `POST /session/error`

The backend should remain small, modular, and focused.

## 🧠 Session Strategy

The user experience should feel like one continuous session.

Internally, the app should treat realtime sessions as resumable and lightweight:

* store only minimal session state
* keep short recent turns
* maintain a compressed summary
* preserve the current goal
* keep the last relevant visual context

## 🖼️ Screen Capture Strategy

Default capture should remain lightweight:

* low FPS
* compressed JPEG frames
* reduced resolution

Increase capture rate only when needed:

* relevant screen change
* visual error or diagram detected
* explicit user request
* temporary high-attention moments

Use HD screenshots only on demand.

## 🔐 Security Rules

* Never embed a permanent API key in the desktop client
* Use ephemeral tokens for realtime sessions
* Keep Electron security strict:

  * `contextIsolation: true`
  * `nodeIntegration: false`
  * privileged APIs only through `preload`

## 📝 Commit Convention

All commits follow the **Conventional Commits** pattern:

```
type(scope): message
```

### Types

| Type | Use when |
|------|----------|
| `feat` | Adding a new feature or capability |
| `fix` | Fixing a bug |
| `chore` | Maintenance, config, dependencies, CI |
| `refactor` | Restructuring code without changing behavior |
| `test` | Adding or updating tests only |
| `docs` | Documentation-only changes |
| `style` | Formatting, whitespace, linting (no logic change) |
| `perf` | Performance improvements |
| `ci` | CI/CD pipeline changes |

### Scopes

| Scope | Covers |
|-------|--------|
| `monorepo` | Root configs, workspace, tooling |
| `shared` | `packages/shared-types`, `packages/shared-utils` |
| `api` | `apps/api` backend |
| `desktop` | `apps/desktop` Electron app |
| `docs` | Documentation files |

### Examples

```
chore(monorepo): scaffold pnpm workspace with root configs
feat(shared): add shared-types and shared-utils packages
feat(api): add NestJS backend with health and session modules
feat(desktop): add Electron app with React renderer and IPC bridge
fix(api): correct token expiry calculation
test(api): add integration tests for session controller
refactor(desktop): extract IPC handlers to separate module
docs(docs): update README with commit conventions
```

### Rules

* Use imperative mood in the message ("add", not "added" or "adds")
* Keep the subject line under 72 characters
* Use the body for details when the subject alone is not enough
* Group related changes into a single commit by logical scope
* Do not mix unrelated changes in the same commit

## 🧪 Development Principles

* Prefer TDD whenever practical and cost-effective
* Keep changes small and reviewable
* Update shared contracts in the same task
* Avoid speculative abstractions
* Protect low-latency behavior from regressions

## 🧰 Local Development

### ✅ Prerequisites

* Node.js
* pnpm
* Linux desktop environment with screen capture support

### 📦 Install

```bash
pnpm install
```

### ▶️ Run the desktop app

Preferred:

```bash
pnpm dev
```

Desktop only:

```bash
pnpm --filter @livepair/desktop dev
```

### ▶️ Run the backend

Preferred:

```bash
pnpm --filter @livepair/api dev
```

### 🧹 Run workspace checks

```bash
pnpm lint
pnpm typecheck
pnpm test
```

Smallest relevant package-level checks:

```bash
pnpm verify:api
pnpm verify:desktop
pnpm verify:shared-types
pnpm verify:shared-utils
```

## 🌍 Environment Variables

### ⚙️ Backend

```bash
PORT=
HOST=
GEMINI_API_KEY=
EPHEMERAL_TOKEN_TTL_SECONDS=
REDIS_URL=
OPEN_DEVTOOLS=
DISABLE_HTTP_LISTEN=
```

### 🖥️ Desktop

The desktop app must not contain a permanent Gemini API key.

## ✅ Testing

Before closing a task:

* run lint
* run typecheck
* run the smallest relevant test set
* add or update tests for behavior changes
* verify the main flow end to end when feasible

## 🎬 Demo Focus

This MVP is optimized for one strong demo scenario, not for breadth.

Recommended focus:

* full-screen awareness
* interruption support
* step-by-step guidance
* stable and polished happy path

## 🛣️ Roadmap

### 🚀 MVP

* Fast mode
* direct client → Live API
* adaptive screen capture
